# Random Password Generator Application

## About

The Random Password Generator Application assignment is a fun one page application the uses and combines a plethora of basic JavaScript concepts:

- Functions
- Arrays
- Objects
- Recursion
- Prompts
- Validation
- EventListeners

The current iteration of the application is fairly optimized by implementing functions where possible in order to DRY (don't repeat yourself) and by using objects to keep information bundled together.
